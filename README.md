# project
You are serving an internship with the traffic court in the city where you live. The clerks in the traffic court office want a simple application that will allow them to enter the actual speed limit, the speed at which the offender was traveling, and the number of previous tickets the person has received.  The application should provide interface options to allow users to 
(1) calculate and print charges; 
(2) repeat 
(3) quit the program
The application should calculate and display how many miles over the speed limit the offender was traveling, the cost of the speeding ticket, and court costs.  The program should calculate a charge of $10.00 for each mile per hour over the speed limit.  The program should calculate court costs beginning at $53.20 for the first offense, and increasing by $20.00 for each subsequent offense up to the third offense (that will represent the maximum court cost).
